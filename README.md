# Self-Driving Car Tutorial & Real Estate Price Prediction App

## Project Overview

1. **Self-Driving Car Tutorial**: A self-driving car simulation project that applies machine learning algorithms to control the movement of a car in a simulated environment.

## Features & Technologies Used

### Self-Driving Car Tutorial:
- **Machine Learning**: Uses machine learning algorithms to enable the car to drive autonomously within a simulated environment.
- **Environment**: A simulation environment where the car can make decisions based on inputs such as images from a camera, sensor data, etc.

## How to Run Locally

### Self-Driving Car Tutorial:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lilamoth/Part1_Self_Driving.git
   ```
2. **Follow the tutorial steps (instructions will be inside the self-driving car folder)**.
3. **Run the simulation** (command or file depends on the specific setup).


## Features Implemented

### Self-Driving Car Tutorial:
- **Autonomous Driving**: The car can navigate through the environment using machine learning techniques.
- **Sensor Integration**: The car makes decisions based on inputs from virtual sensors or camera feeds.
